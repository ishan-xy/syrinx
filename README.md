### **About the Project**

This is a multiplayer, gamified capture-the-flag (CTF) type platform designed to host cybersecurity challenges.

Inspired by the campus of Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, the game allows players to roam a 2D map, find and solve riddles, and complete challenges. Solving them grants points that are added to a live leaderboard, ranking teams based on their score. The game is played in teams of up to four people, and the team with the highest score at the end of the time limit wins. The platform also includes a built-in hint mechanism to help players who get stuck.

### **Gameplay and Features**

The primary objective is to solve riddles and challenges hidden throughout the map. The competition is structured in a tournament format with three progressive rounds, with each map increasing in difficulty. Players are eliminated after each round, and the final top three rank holders are determined in the last round.

Key features include:

  * **Live Leaderboard:** Tracks and ranks teams based on real-time scores.
  * **Hint Mechanism:** Provides assistance to players who need help with challenges.
  * **Progressive Difficulty:** Three distinct maps, each with increasing difficulty.
  * **Multiplayer Gameplay:** Supports teams of up to four people.
